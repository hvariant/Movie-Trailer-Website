# Movie-Trailer-Website

This is the repository for the first project of Udacity's Fullstack Web Developer
[nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)
program. It generates an html file dynamically in Python from a list of movies. The
html file shows the poster, title of the movies and clicking on the posters will open
the movie's trailer.

## Usage

1.  To add or change the movie list edit the file 'movies.txt' and add or remove lines.
    Each line should consist of the url of the movie's trailer URL, title, and poster URL
    separated by space. If a movie title contains multiple words they should be joined by
    the underscore character '\_'.

2.  To generate and open the webpage run:

        `./entertainment_center.py`

    Or:
        
        `python2 entertainment_center.py`
   
    This will automatically generate and open in a browser an html file called
    `fresh_tomatoes.html`.
